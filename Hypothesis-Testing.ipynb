    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: A hypothesis is an educated guess about something in the world around you. It should be testable, either by experiment or observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis statement**: A good hypothesis statement should:\n",
    "* Include an “if” and “then” statement.\n",
    "* Include both the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "* Be testable by experiment, survey or other scientifically sound technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Testing**: Hypothesis testing in statistics is a way for you to test the results of a survey or experiment to see if you have meaningful results. You’re basically testing whether your results are valid by figuring out the odds that your results have happened by chance. If your results may have happened by chance, the experiment won’t be repeatable and so has little use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Testing Process**:\n",
    "* Figure out your null hypothesis.\n",
    "* State your null hypothesis.\n",
    "* Choose what kind of test you need to perform.\n",
    "* Either support or reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption of a statistical test is called the null hypothesis, or hypothesis 0 (H0 for short). It is often called the default assumption, or the assumption that nothing has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A violation of the test’s assumption is often called the first hypothesis, hypothesis 1 or H1 for short. H1 is really a short hand for “some other hypothesis,” as all we know is that the evidence suggests that the H0 can be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 0 (H0)**: Assumption of the test holds and is failed to be rejected at some level of significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 1 (H1)**: Assumption of the test does not hold and is rejected at some level of significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, we must interpret the result of the test\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Test Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical hypothesis test may return a value called p or the p-value. This is a quantity that we can use to interpret or quantify the result of the test and either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. This is done by comparing the p-value to a threshold value chosen beforehand called the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level is often referred to by the Greek lower case letter alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common value used for alpha is 5% or 0.05. A smaller alpha value suggests a more robust interpretation of the null hypothesis, such as 1% or 0.1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is compared to the pre-chosen alpha value. A result is statistically significant when the p-value is less than alpha. This signifies a change was detected: that the default hypothesis can be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If p-value > alpha: Fail to reject the null hypothesis (i.e. not significant result).\n",
    "\n",
    "If p-value <= alpha: Reject the null hypothesis (i.e. significant result)."
